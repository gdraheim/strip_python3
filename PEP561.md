# PEP561

The PEP561 defines how to ensure that `*.pyi` files get included for
packaging. It does recommend to create a "py.typed" file in the module 
directory. However that does NOT apply for "module-only packages", that 
is a single python file without a directory (in src/).

Instead the pyi file has to be moved to a kind of typeshed whereas "mypy"
recognizes a stubs-module in the sys.path. So when we have `"systemctl.py"` 
then the typhints are put into `"systemctl-stubs/__init__.py"`.

In the real-world example of [docker-systemctl-replacement](https://github.com/gdraheim/docker-systemctl-replacement)
the directory layout is 

        docker-systemctl-replacement/
           src/
              journalctl3.py
              systemctl3.py
           tests/
              localtests2.py
           Makefile
           pyproject.toml
       
After running `make 2` doing

          strip-python3 --old-python --stubs src/systemctl3.py -o src/systemctl.py
      
then the directory structure is

        docker-systemctl-replacement/
           src/
              journalctl3.py
              systemctl3.py
              systemctl.py
              systemctl-stubs/
                  __init__.pyi
           tests/
              localtests2.py
           Makefile
           pyproject.toml
       
This will make pyproject.toml to pick up all `*.py` in src/ and the `systemctl-stubs/` directory.

        Location: /home/..../.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages
        Files:
           journalctl3.py
           systemctl-stubs/__init__.pyi
           systemctl.py
           systemctl3.py
           
With that it is possible to write a short test file:

        from systemctl import main

        main()

and get it typechecked by "mypy" successfully as it can find the `*.pyi` for `systemctl.py`.

        mypy --strict testprog.py
